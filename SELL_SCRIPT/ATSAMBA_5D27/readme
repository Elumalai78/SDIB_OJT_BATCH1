              LED RAEDME FILE

This Bash shell script tests a LED connected to a GPIO pin on a Linux device.
step 1
exports GPIO pin 77, which means it makes the pin available for use through the filesystem.
step 2
sets the direction of GPIO pin PC13 to "out", which means it configures the pin as an output.
step 3
reads the current value of GPIO pin PC13 and stores it in a variable named "status".
step 4
starts a conditional block that checks if the value of the "status" variable is equal to 0.
	LED ON
step 5
